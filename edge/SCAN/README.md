# MTU Size

<br>

To run the MTU Analyzer directly in Termux, just copy and paste this command:

```bash
pkg install curl -y && curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NiREvil/vless/refs/heads/main/edge/SCAN/MTU.sh | bash
```

<br>

From next time, run it without installing curl

```bash
pkg install curl -y && curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NiREvil/vless/refs/heads/main/edge/SCAN/MTU.sh | bash
```
